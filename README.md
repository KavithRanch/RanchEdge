## Motivation

Melting my passions for sports and data analytics, the domain used to explore these ideas is the sports betting markets, but the system design and evaluation principles generalize to other decision-making problems under uncertainty.

RanchEdge focuses on:
- Identifying opportunities where market prices are misaligned
- Making decisions based on expected value, not outcomes
- Evaluating decision quality over time rather than win/loss results

## Key Features

### Market-Based Opportunity Detection
- Ingests sportsbook odds for NBA player prop markets
- Converts odds to implied probabilities
- Removes bookmaker margin (vig)
- Builds a market-consensus probability
- Identifies positive expected value (+EV) opportunities

### Transparent EV Explanations
- Displays to users how expected value is calculated
- Compares prices across sportsbooks
- Surfaces assumptions and data freshness

### Decision Tracking
- Users can log bets they choose to take
- Stores the probability and EV at decision time
- Separates system output from user actions

### Performance Evaluation
- Compares **expected performance vs actual user outcomes**
- Tracks ROI and EV-based ROI over time
- Emphasizes process quality over short-term variance

### System Baseline
- Simulates a “bet everything” strategy using flat stakes
- Provides a baseline to evaluate both the system and user selection behavior

## Project Roadmap
- [ ] ***v1.0.0: Complete MVP***
- [ ] **v0.10.0**: Performance Dashboard
- [ ] **v0.9.0**: Bet logging (selection/outcome)
- [ ] **v0.8.0**: Basic UI dev (opportunities dashboard)
- [ ] **v0.7.0**: Basic API endpoints for EV access
    * Created "Controller" Layer (router within api/v1) and Service Layer for ev opportunities endpoint
    * Defined API Schemas to support return object for ev opportunities
    * Updated documentation for 📄[**FastAPI**](docs/personal_learning/fastapi_info.md) with use cases 
    * Documentation for 📄[`api/v1/ev_opportunities`](backend/backend_docs/api_docs/ev_opportunities_api.md) endpoint 
    * Up-to-date documentation for my personal understanding of 📄[**APIs and their design process**](docs/personal_learning/api_design.md) 
- [x] **v0.6.0**: EV Opportunities Generation
    * Create positive ev opportunity generation and persistence into db using the current true_probability calculation method (Can always change using the constant DEFAULT_TP_METHOD as new ways of calculating it arrive)
    * New Model implemented to store calculated ev_opportunities available
    * CLI script enables entry point through cmd for ev_opportunity generation
    * Added pytest integration file which uses a temporary sqlite db
    * Updated documentation for 📄[**initial local dev setup**](docs/initial_setup.md), 📄[**Odds Data Pipeline File Structure**](backend/backend_docs/oddspipeline_folder_structure.md), 📄[**DB Schema**](backend/backend_docs/db_schema.md) and 📄[**EV**](backend/backend_docs/ev_info.md) 
- [x] **v0.5.0**: True probability calculation
    * Tidied up logging statements and relative levels
    * CLI script enables entry point through cmd for true_probability calculation
    * Created MVP true probability calculation by using vig-free mean of probabilties for each outcome
    * New Model implemented to store calculated true probabilities (one row per market per outcome)
    * Added pytest integration file which uses a temporary sqlite db
    * Created documentation for 📄[**initial local dev setup**](docs/initial_setup.md) outlining setup accurate as of the completion of v0.5.0

        2. Normalizes data into a relational schema 
        3. Results in time-stamped price snapshots that support historical analysis, line movement tracking, and future EV calculations. 
    * Created models for all odds ingestion related tables and seed tables
    * Created alembic migration files and applied them to the db
    * Created scripts for filling seed tables and for pulling odds from OddsApi
    * Implemented CLI scripts to setup seeding and data persistence

    * Implemented required EV calculations assuming fair probability is true prob for MVP
    * Created testing files passing 100%

    * **docker-compose.yml** file setup for detailing how subsystems should be connected
    * Up-to-date documentation for my personal understanding of 📄[**docker**](docs/personal_learning/docker_info.md) and 📄[**FastAPI**](docs/personal_learning/fastapi_info.md) based on usage of each tool so far
    * Documentation of 📄[**MVP**](docs/mvp.md) outlining **v1.0.0 scope**
